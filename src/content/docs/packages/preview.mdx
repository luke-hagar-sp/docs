### Overview
`@volar/preview` provides utilities to bootstrap interactive previews/playgrounds that use Volar language services under the hood. It’s useful for documentation sites and demos.

### Install

```bash
npm i @volar/preview
```

### Usage

```ts
import { createPreviewApp } from '@volar/preview';
import { create as createHtml } from 'volar-service-html';

const app = await createPreviewApp({
  files: {
    '/index.html': '<div>Hello</div>',
  },
  getServicePlugins: () => [createHtml()],
});

app.mount('#app');
```

### Notes
- Often paired with `@volar/monaco` to provide the editor part
- Provides simple file system abstractions and wiring for demos
