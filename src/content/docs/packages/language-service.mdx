title: "@volar/language-service"
description: The service runtime that executes plugins (services) over core documents and routes feature requests.
---

### Overview
`@volar/language-service` is the execution layer for Volar plugins (aka “services”). It takes documents and virtual files from `@volar/language-core` and runs feature providers (completion, hover, diagnostics, etc.) supplied by your services.

Use this to:
- Compose multiple services (HTML, CSS, TS, YAML, custom) into a single language-service
- Orchestrate request routing, deduplication, and result merging

### How it works
- Accepts a project/document provider and a list of service plugins
- Each plugin implements some subset of language features
- The language service calls plugins, merges results, and returns LSP-like data structures

### Install

```bash
npm i @volar/language-service
```

### Usage

```ts
import { createLanguageService } from '@volar/language-service';
import { createLanguage } from '@volar/language-core';
import { create as createHtml } from 'volar-service-html';
import { create as createCss } from 'volar-service-css';
import { create as createTs } from 'volar-service-typescript';

const core = createLanguage();
const ls = createLanguageService({
  language: core,
  getServicePlugins() {
    return [createHtml(), createCss(), createTs()];
  },
});

// Example: completions
const completions = await ls.provideCompletionItems(uri, position);
```

### API summary
- `createLanguageService({ language, getServicePlugins })`
- Methods: `provideCompletionItems`, `provideHover`, `provideDiagnostics`, etc.
- Result-merging utilities and cancellation handling

### Notes
- Keep plugin execution fast; prefer incremental caches keyed by document versions
- Return partial results where supported
