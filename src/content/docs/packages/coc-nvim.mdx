description: coc.nvim client integration for Volar language servers in (Neo)Vim.
---

### Overview
`@volar/coc.nvim` provides a ready-to-use coc.nvim client configuration for Volar-based language servers. It wires the Volar LSP server to coc.nvim so you get completions, hovers, diagnostics, refactors, rename, inlay hints, semantic tokens, and more in Vim/Neovim.

### Install

```bash
npm i -D @volar/coc.nvim
```

Also ensure coc.nvim is installed in your editor.

### Usage
Add a language server entry to your `:CocConfig` (usually `~/.config/nvim/coc-settings.json`):

```json
{
  "languageserver": {
    "volar": {
      "module": "@volar/coc.nvim",
      "args": [],
      "filetypes": ["html", "vue", "markdown", "json", "yaml", "javascript", "javascriptreact", "typescript", "typescriptreact"],
      "initializationOptions": {
        "getServicePlugins": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Set `filetypes` to the languages your server supports.
- Pass any project-specific initialization options as needed.

### How it works
- Exposes a coc.nvim-compatible client module that spawns a Volar LSP server
- Bridges LSP requests/responses between coc.nvim and the server
- Respects coc.nvim workspace and configuration facilities

### API summary
This package is consumed by coc.nvim through its “languageserver.module” entry. You typically don’t import it directly in application code.

### Tips
- For large repos, prefer workspaceFolders-aware setups and enable incremental features in your server configuration
- Use `:CocCommand` to inspect logs when diagnosing issues
