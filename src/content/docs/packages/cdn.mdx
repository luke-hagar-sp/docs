### Overview
`@volar/cdn` helps load Volar pieces from a CDN (ESM) for quick demos and zero-build setups.

### Install

```bash
npm i @volar/cdn
```

Or load directly from a CDN (e.g. jsDelivr):

```html
<script type="module">
  import { createMonacoLanguageService } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@volar/monaco/+esm';
  // ...
</script>
```

### Usage
- Combine with `@volar/monaco` and service plugins
- Good for playgrounds, embedding editors in docs sites
