description: Utilities to integrate ESLint diagnostics and fixes with Volar-based tooling.
---

### Overview
`@volar/eslint` offers helpers to run ESLint in tandem with Volar’s document model and surface results via LSP-like diagnostics and code actions. It’s useful when your language server should report ESLint findings alongside other language features.

### Install

```bash
npm i @volar/eslint eslint
```

### Usage
Use from a Volar service/plugin to execute ESLint against current snapshots and map results to diagnostics:

```ts
import { createEslintRunner } from '@volar/eslint';

const run = await createEslintRunner({
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  eslintOptions: {}, // your ESLint CLIEngine/ESLint options
});

const results = await run.lintText(text, filePath);
// Convert to LSP diagnostics and return from your service
```

### How it works
- Adapts ESLint to Volar’s snapshot model
- Helps convert ESLint messages to LSP diagnostics and code actions
- Supports partial/lazy execution to keep keystroke latency low

### API summary
- `createEslintRunner({ cwd?, eslintOptions? })`
- Utilities to map ESLint results to diagnostics/actions

### Best practices
- Cache ESLint instances; avoid reloading configs on every keystroke
- Limit lint-on-type to small files or throttle for responsiveness
