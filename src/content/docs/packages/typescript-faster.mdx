description: Experimental performance-focused TypeScript integration helpers for Volar.
---

### Overview
`@volar/typescript-faster` explores configurations and adapters to reduce latency of TS-powered features in large workspaces. Trade-offs may include reduced completeness under certain conditions.

### Install

```bash
npm i @volar/typescript-faster typescript
```

### Usage

```ts
import { createFastTsProject } from '@volar/typescript-faster';
const project = createFastTsProject({ tsconfigPath: './tsconfig.json' });
```

### Techniques
- Aggressive caching of parsed source files
- Skipping seldom-used TS services on keystroke
- Debounced/batched updates

### Notes
- Consider for very large repos or constrained environments
- Validate feature coverage for your use cases
