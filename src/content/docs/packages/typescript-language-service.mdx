description: Helpers to expose the TypeScript Language Service through Volar’s service API.
---

### Overview
`@volar/typescript-language-service` focuses on adapting the raw TypeScript Language Service to Volar’s service/plugin interface. It provides scaffolding to translate TS LS requests/responses into LSP-like features used by editors.

### Install

```bash
npm i @volar/typescript-language-service typescript
```

### Usage

```ts
import { createTsLanguageServiceAdapter } from '@volar/typescript-language-service';
import * as ts from 'typescript';

const adapter = createTsLanguageServiceAdapter({ ts, tsconfigPath: './tsconfig.json' });
// Use it within a Volar service plugin to provide TS-based features
```

### How it works
- Creates a TS LS instance and maps its outputs (edits, locations, etc.) to Volar feature methods
- Bridges virtual files and source maps so TS results align with original sources

### API summary
- Builders/adapters for TS LS
- Converters for TS result types to LSP-like structures

### Best practices
- Align your document lifecycle with TS project updates to avoid stale symbols
- Cache symbol and semantic data per snapshot version
