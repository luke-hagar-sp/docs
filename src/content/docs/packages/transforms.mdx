### Overview
`@volar/transforms` provides utilities to transform LSP-like results (completions, hovers, edits, diagnostics) between different coordinate spaces, typically source-to-generated or generated-to-source using source maps.

### Install

```bash
npm i @volar/transforms
```

### Usage

```ts
import { transformLocations } from '@volar/transforms';

const sourceLocations = transformLocations(generatedLocations, sourceMap, 'toSource');
```

### API summary
- Location, Range, TextEdit transformers
- Collections: arrays of locations/edits/diagnostics
- Merge and dedupe helpers

### Best practices
- Always pair with accurate `@volar/source-map` mappings
- Avoid double-transforming the same payload
