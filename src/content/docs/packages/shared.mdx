title: "@volar/shared"
description: Common types, utilities, and constants used across Volar packages.
---

### Overview
`@volar/shared` contains reusable primitives (types, guards, small helpers) shared by multiple packages. It avoids duplicating small utilities across repos.

### Install

```bash
npm i @volar/shared
```

### Contents
- Type guards and small data structures
- URI/path helpers, normalization routines
- Constants used across services and servers

### Usage

```ts
import { isNotNull, toUri } from '@volar/shared';

const uri = toUri('/workspace/file.ts');
items.filter(isNotNull);
```

### Notes
- Keep `shared` focused on small, stable utilities to prevent dependency bloat
