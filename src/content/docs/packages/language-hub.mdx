description: Compose and coordinate multiple Volar language services across files, projects, and workspaces.
---

### Overview
`@volar/language-hub` is a high-level coordinator that helps you compose multiple language services and route requests across complex project structures. It’s useful for monorepos, multi-root workspaces, and tools that stitch together several embedded-language stacks.

### Install

```bash
npm i @volar/language-hub
```

### Usage

```ts
import { createLanguageHub } from '@volar/language-hub';
import { createLanguageService } from '@volar/language-service';

const htmlLs = createLanguageService({...});
const tsLs = createLanguageService({...});

const hub = createLanguageHub([htmlLs, tsLs]);

const hover = await hub.provideHover(uri, position);
```

### How it works
- Maintains a registry of child language services
- Routes feature requests based on file types, virtual file ownership, or custom rules
- Merges and deduplicates results where appropriate

### API summary
- `createLanguageHub(services: LanguageService[])`
- Forwards: `provide*` feature methods with result merging

### Notes
- Keep service ownership rules simple; prefer single-owner per virtual file to reduce duplication
- Use for orchestration; keep heavy lifting inside individual services
