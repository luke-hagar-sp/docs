description: Building blocks to integrate the TypeScript Language Service with Volar core.
---

### Overview
`@volar/typescript` contains adapters and helpers that connect Volar’s virtual files and source maps to the TypeScript Language Service (TS LS). Use it when authoring TS-powered services or servers.

### Install

```bash
npm i @volar/typescript typescript
```

### Usage

```ts
import * as ts from 'typescript';
import { createTypeScriptProject } from '@volar/typescript';

const project = createTypeScriptProject({
  ts,
  tsconfigPath: './tsconfig.json',
  // supply host hooks that read from Volar’s virtual file system, if needed
});
```

### How it works
- Creates and manages a TS Program/Language Service backed by your documents
- Knows how to expose TS features through Volar’s service abstractions

### API summary
- Project builders and host factories
- Helpers to query TS LS for completions/diagnostics/edits and map results back

### Performance
- Reuse TS Programs; update incrementally
- Use Volar snapshots for stable reads; avoid re-parsing the same text
