description: Integrate Pug into Volar for template authoring.
---

### What it does
Adds Pug template language features (diagnostics, completions, hovers, formatting, symbols) for Pug blocks and files.

### How it works
Provides a Pug-aware service that parses and maps Pug templates to HTML/AST behind Volar’s service interface, enabling common LSP hooks.

### Why use it
- First-class Pug authoring in frameworks that embed Pug templates.

### Install

```bash
npm i volar-service-pug
```

### Usage

```ts
import { create as createPug } from 'volar-service-pug';

getServicePlugins() {
  return [
    createPug(),
  ];
}
```

### API
- Export: `create(options?) => ServicePlugin`
- Implements: provideCompletionItems/resolveCompletionItem, provideHover, provideDocumentSymbols, provideDocumentFormattingEdits/Range, provideFoldingRanges, provideSelectionRanges, diagnostics.
