description: Integrate yaml-language-server into Volar.
---

### What it does
Provides YAML features including schema-based validation, completions, hovers, formatting, and symbols for `.yaml`/`.yml`.

### How it works
Embeds `yaml-language-server` through Volar’s service interface to serve LSP-like functionality for YAML.

### Why use it
- YAML authoring with JSON Schema support inside embedded-language projects.

### Install

```bash
npm i volar-service-yaml
```

### Usage

```ts
import { create as createYaml } from 'volar-service-yaml';

getServicePlugins() {
  return [
    createYaml(),
  ];
}
```

### API
- Export: `create(options?) => ServicePlugin`
- Implements (via YAML LS): provideCompletionItems/resolveCompletionItem, provideHover, provideDocumentSymbols, provideDocumentLinks, provideDocumentFormattingEdits/Range, provideFoldingRanges, diagnostics (schema-aware).
