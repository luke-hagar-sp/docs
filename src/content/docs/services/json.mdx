description: Integrate vscode-json-languageservice into Volar.
---

### What it does
Provides JSON features with schema-aware validation, completions, hovers, formatting, and symbols for `.json` and embedded JSON.

### How it works
Wraps `vscode-json-languageservice` to respond to Volar service hooks, optionally leveraging JSON Schemas discovered by the upstream LS.

### Why use it
- First-class JSON authoring and schema support in embedded contexts and plain `.json`.

### Install

```bash
npm i volar-service-json
```

### Usage

```ts
import { create as createJson } from 'volar-service-json';

getServicePlugins() {
  return [
    createJson(),
  ];
}
```

### API
- Export: `create(options?) => ServicePlugin`
- Implements (via JSON LS): provideCompletionItems/resolveCompletionItem, provideHover, provideDocumentSymbols, provideDocumentLinks, provideDocumentFormattingEdits/Range, provideFoldingRanges, provideSelectionRanges, diagnostics (schema-based).
