description: Integrate TypeScript features into Volar.
---

### What it does
Provides TypeScript language features (completions, diagnostics, hovers, definitions, references, code actions/refactors, inlay hints, semantic tokens, formatting) for `script` blocks and TS/JS files in embedded projects.

### How it works
Bridges the TypeScript Language Service into Volar’s service runtime and handles embedded TS/JS via virtual documents and source maps.

### Why use it
- First-class TS/JS authoring in frameworks with embedded scripts.

### Install

```bash
npm i volar-service-typescript
```

### Usage

```ts
import { create as createTs } from 'volar-service-typescript';

getServicePlugins() {
  return [
    createTs(),
  ];
}
```

### API
- Export: `create(options?) => ServicePlugin`
- Implements (via TS LS): provideCompletionItems/resolveCompletionItem, provideHover, provideSignatureHelp, provideDefinition, provideReferences, provideCallHierarchyItems/IncomingCalls/OutgoingCalls, provideCodeActions/resolveCodeAction, provideRenameEdits, provideDocumentSemanticTokens/Edits, provideInlayHints/resolveInlayHint, provideDocumentSymbols, provideDocumentFormattingEdits/Range/OnType, diagnostics, more TS-specific transforms.
