description: Provide incremental semantic token edits based on a previous result.
---

## Overview
Return either a full token set or an edits structure to update the client efficiently.

## Signature
`(document: TextDocument, previousResultId: string, token: CancellationToken) => SemanticTokens | SemanticTokensEdits | Promise<SemanticTokens | SemanticTokensEdits>`

## Best practices
- Track `resultId` to compute diffs across snapshots.
- Fall back to full result if diff is too large or state is invalid.
